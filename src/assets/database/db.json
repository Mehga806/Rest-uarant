Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worth competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. when you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner. But, if you go a step further and add the salty from the pepperoni, the sweet from the honey, and the spicy from the chili oil.... your mouth is confused and happy at the same time."

Seriously, a bunch of meat albeit you can sample beforehand on rye/white/wheat bread. Cheese extra. Pickles free, you can just ask them at the pickup counter. But seriously 20 bucks gone for an non-flavored half sandwich. And a line that is long, especially if you want seating. I'm down to just take a quick look where Sally and Harry sat and leave to the other delis all around NYC. Oh and they accept Samsung pay."

It has A LOT of hype in the New York food scene, and I question if it deserves all of it, but it's still a totally great spot to hit up when in the area!!"

Their pork tacos are to die for, their different variety of ribs and lastly, their lamb is not gamey at all. Super wallet friendly for the amount they give you. I highly recommend this spot- after eating here, you can definitely walk over for Steve's key lime pies."

The food is surprisingly well-executed and conceived, and our dinner service flowed smoothly without a hitch. Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I'm sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea."
